### About

This is my first version for a **very simple** matching game made as a final project for [Udacity](http://www.udacuty.com)'s "JavaScript Foundations" course.

The player should flip a card and then flip another card, trying to find the one that matches with the first card flipped.

When the game finishes, it shows an modal with the time and how many moves the player took to find all all pairs. There is a score that changes between 3 and 1 stars. It depends of how many moves were made.

### TO DO:

* a nicer final modal;
* a two-players mode;
* a board of records;
* some animation to the cards;
* hard and easy level mode.
